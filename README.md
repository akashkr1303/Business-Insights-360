# Business Insights 360


## Project Objective:
To develop a multi-functional Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Hardwares that can enable stakeholders to draw detailed insight and make data-informed decisions. The company cannot rely on Excel for its data-related needs and it wants to transition to Power BI for its analytics needs to help drive business growth.

## Business Model:
AtliQ Hardware is a firm that manufactures computer hardware, accessories, storage & networking devices and sells its products through various customers like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart and its direct stores across regions using different modes of channels.

## Project Description: 
In this project, I designed and customised a Power BI report with 5 different views - (Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain View, Executive) which analyzes business metrics related to a specific department and provides actionable insights. Built snowflake schema involving 20+ tables and created 60+ measures using DAX. Created 10+ different types of visuals for all the views. Increased the performance of the report by 18% using DAX Studio and also published the report on the Power BI service. The report consists of:-


#### i) Finance View - Outlines the financial performance of the business based on different selections like fiscal year, quarters, targets or LY (last year). It includes visuals like

##### a) P & L Table - all metrics included
